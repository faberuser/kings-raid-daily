- Multiple LDPlayer Emulator with tablet resolution (`960x540`, `1280x720`, `1600x900`, `1920x1080`)
##### If you want the script to auto LoH, resolution with `1280x720` or higher is recommended because this script is currently having unexpected issue while sending events to `960x540` resolution so sometimes it doesn't work or not as expected

#### Script and Emulator configuration:
- Double click/Open `generate-shortcut.bat` to generate shortcut point to executables in `kings-raid-daily` folder
- `2 cores CPU` and `4GB RAM` or above is recommended
- Open emulator's `Settings` and head to `Other settings` (or `Basic` on lower LDPlayer version) on the left menu, change `@adb_debug`/`ADB debugging` to `Open local connection`
- Run the script `kings-raid-daily` and press 4 or edit directly in `config.json` / import config from previous version by press 5 and select `config.json` file in `kings-raid-daily` folder
##### Default configuration will set scoring content include `LoV (League of Victory)`, `LoH (League of Honor)`, `WB (World Boss)` to disable
##### To view current configuration, run the script `kings-raid-daily` and press 5

#### Ingame setup:
- Set up all team can clear all `stockage dungeons` (all 4 dungeons) and make sure **auto mode is on**
- Make sure inventory is not full in each execution
- If `WB` or `LoV` is enabled: Set up all team and make sure **auto mode is on**
- If `Dragon` is enabled: End all dispatch **or** set an entire team (6 heroes) in `Dragon T6 Stage 1` while all of your dispatch teams is running (you can't use dispatching-heroes in raid)

##### To disable startup, open `Task Manager`, click `Startup` tab then find `kings-raid-daily-background.exe` and disable it
##### To end process, open `Task Manager` and click `End task` both `adb.exe` and `kings-raid-daily-background.exe`
